title: "Asks status changes"
slug: "geteventsasksv3"
excerpt: "Every time an ask status changes, an event is generated. This API is designed to be polled at high frequency, in order to keep an external system in sync with accurate prices for any token.\n\nThere are multiple event types, which describe what caused the change in price:\n\n- `new-order` > new listing at a lower price\n\n- `expiry` > the previous best listing expired\n\n- `sale` > the previous best listing was filled\n\n- `cancel` > the previous best listing was canceled\n\n- `balance-change` > the best listing was invalidated due to no longer owning the NFT\n\n- `approval-change` > the best listing was invalidated due to revoked approval\n\n- `revalidation` > manual revalidation of orders (e.g. after a bug fixed)\n\n- `reprice` > price update for dynamic orders (e.g. dutch auctions)\n\n- `bootstrap` > initial loading of data, so that all tokens have a price associated\n\nNote: Private listings (asks) will not appear in the results."
