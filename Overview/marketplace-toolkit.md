Reservoir's marketplace toolkit is a modular set of tools that allows you to interact with the NFT market at the appropriate level of abstraction for your application. The basic components of the toolkit are:

# [NFT Trading & Data APIs](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/overview)

 Reservoir APIs provide all-in-one endpoints for building NFT applications. The NFT trading APIs allow you to trade NFTs across major NFT marketplaces and create your own orderbook with advanced order types and custom fees. The NFT data APIs provide granular token price data, real-time collection floor price and top bid events, token and collection metadata, and more. The API is wrapped in an easy -to-use  [TS/JS SDK](ref:reservoir-sdk-jstsnode) with performant methods.

# [ReservoirKit](doc:reservoirkit-ui)

 ReservoirKit is a React library that makes it easy to add marketplace functionality into your project. The kit has out of the box and customizable (headless) modals for major market actions, as well as a series of useful hooks to simplify development.
