Reservoir offers a [websocket service](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/websockets) that provides real-time updates on events to subscribed developers. With this service, developers can receive updates without the need for constant polling. Supported events include `top-bid.changed`, `ask.created`, `ask.updated`, `bid.created`, and `bid.updated`, and each event has specific tags that can be used to narrow down the events received. It's worth noting that websockets are only available on Reservoir's paid plans. More information on Reservoir's subscription plans can be found on their [pricing page](https://reservoir.tools/pricing), and event payloads can be viewed on the Reservoir [documentation](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/payloads-1).

Reservoir is an on-chain and off-chain trading infrastructure for non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The platform provides various APIs and tools for developers to create and manage NFT markets, including order book management, trade execution, and market data aggregation.
