Reservoir native orders get instantly distributed to any marketplaces that get built on top of Reservoir's developer products and [OpenSea Pro](https://pro.opensea.io/). 

While native orders are not automatically posted into OpenSea, our router makes it easy to execute that within our APIs, SDKs, etc. 

Read more about cross-posting orders (e.g. OpenSea) [here](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs/bulk-order-creation).
