###Marketplace Fees:
Marketplace fees are charged to users for buying NFTs that were listed on a particular marketplace. These fees are set when the order is created and must be paid regardless of where the order is filled.

###Royalty Fees:
Royalty fees are paid to the creator of an NFT when the NFT is sold on a marketplace.If royalties were not set in the original order, it is possible to include them via Reservoir's `normalizedRoyalties` feature.
