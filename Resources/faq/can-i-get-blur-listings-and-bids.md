Yes, Reservoir aggregates Blur listings and bids. Blur listings are returned alongside other supported marketplace listings in our [tokens](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/gettokensv5) and [orders](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/getordersasksv4) endpoints. 

We are working on adding the ability to purchase Blur items in loan escrow (e.g. Blend).
