Marketplace fees are built into the order. Referral fees are taken on top when filling the order. For Example, you could take fees on top when filling an OpenSea order on your marketplace built with Reservoir that already has a marketplace fee.

You can read more about custom fees [here](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs/custom-fees).
