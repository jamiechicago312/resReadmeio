Reservoir hosted API is currently available on several chains:  
-Ethereum,  
-Goerli (testnet)  
-Polygon  
-Arbitrum (beta)  
-Optimism (beta) 

These chains allow for a wide range of NFT transactions across multiple marketplaces. Additionally, Reservoir is continuously working on expanding its network and plans to add more EVM compatible chains soon. As an open infrastructure, Reservoir offers developers a suite of tools to create custom marketplaces, embed buying and selling features into their apps, and receive wider distribution for their protocol's liquidity. Whether it's for creating a new NFT platform or integrating NFTs into an existing project, Reservoir provides the tools necessary to build and enhance the NFT ecosystem.
