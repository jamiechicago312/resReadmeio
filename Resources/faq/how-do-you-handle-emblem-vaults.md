Emblem Vaults are used for bitcoin NFTs, which includes ordinals but also other bitcoin NFTs like Rare Pepes.

By default they're all in one collection. But we break out the Ordinals into their own collections. We use an API provided by Ordinals Markets team to group things into collections.

In terms of vaults that contain multiple NFTs, we don't handle that right now. We would just consider it a single NFT
