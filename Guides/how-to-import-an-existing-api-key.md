Any existing and unclaimed API key can be easily imported into your companyâ€™s [Reservoir account](https://docs.reservoir.tools/reference/rate-limits) with the existing rate limits remaining the same at no additional cost.

To import your existing key, simply navigate to the App page and click the Import Key button.

An email will be sent to the original creator of the key. Open this email and accept the request to import the key.

Note: If you no longer have access to the email that created the key please [contact our support team](https://docs.reservoir.tools/docs#contact-us) for assistance.
