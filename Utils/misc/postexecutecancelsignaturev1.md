title: "Off-chain cancel orders"
slug: "postexecutecancelsignaturev1"
excerpt: "If your order was created using the Seaport Oracle to allow off chain & gasless cancellations, you can just use the Kit's cancel modals, SDK's `cancelOrder`, or `/execute/cancel/`. Those tools will automatically access this endpoint for an oracle cancellation without you directly calling this endpoint."
